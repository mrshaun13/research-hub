// ─── EARTH ROTATION, DAY/NIGHT, SEASONS ───────────────────────────

  title: 'Why Do We Have Day and Night?',
  explanation: 'Earth spins like a top! This spinning is called rotation. It takes about 24 hours (one whole day) for Earth to spin around once. The side facing the Sun gets sunlight — that is daytime! The side facing away from the Sun is in shadow — that is nighttime!',
  keyFacts: [
    'Earth spins counterclockwise (to the left) if you look down from the North Pole.',
    'Earth spins at about 1,000 miles per hour at the equator — but you cannot feel it!',
    'The Sun does not actually move across the sky — it just LOOKS like it does because WE are spinning!',
    'When it is daytime where you live, it is nighttime on the other side of the world.',
    'Earth also travels around the Sun at 67,000 miles per hour — like a super-fast spaceship!',

  title: 'Why Do We Have Seasons?',
  explanation: 'Earth is tilted! Imagine holding a ball and tilting it a little to the side — that is what Earth does. Earth is tilted at 23.5 degrees. As Earth travels around the Sun during the year, this tilt means different parts of Earth get more or less sunlight. More sunlight = warmer (summer!). Less sunlight = cooler (winter!).',
  keyFacts: [
    'Earth is tilted at 23.5 degrees — that is what causes our seasons!',
    'It is NOT because Earth is closer or farther from the Sun (that is a common mistake!).',

  explanation: 'The Moon does not make its own light — it reflects light from the Sun, like a mirror! As the Moon travels around Earth (which takes about 29.5 days), we see different amounts of the lit-up side. These different shapes are called phases!',
  keyFacts: [
    'The Moon takes about 29.5 days to go through all its phases — that is almost one month!',
    'The word "month" actually comes from the word "Moon"!',
    'The Moon always shows the same face to Earth — we never see the back side from here!',

    funFact: 'Polaris (the North Star) is not the brightest star in the sky — it is actually the 48th brightest! But it is super important because it always stays in the same spot, pointing north.',

    funFact: 'Cassiopeia is visible all year round from most of the Northern Hemisphere because it circles around the North Star and never sets below the horizon!',

    mythology: 'In Greek mythology, a scorpion stung and killed the hunter Orion. That is why Orion and Scorpius are never in the sky at the same time — Orion runs away when Scorpius rises!',
