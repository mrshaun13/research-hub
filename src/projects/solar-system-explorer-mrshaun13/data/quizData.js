  {
    question: 'How many planets are in our solar system?',
    options: ['7', '8', '9', '10'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'There are 8 planets! Pluto was reclassified as a "dwarf planet" in 2006.',
    coaching: 'Count them: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune — that is 8! Pluto is now called a dwarf planet.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which group of planets are called the "Rocky Planets"?',
    options: ['Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune', 'Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars', 'Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn', 'Venus, Earth, Neptune, Pluto'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are the inner rocky planets — they have solid surfaces!',
    coaching: 'The 4 planets closest to the Sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) are small and rocky with solid surfaces. The outer planets are gas and ice giants.',
  },

export const planetExplorerQuiz = [
  {
    question: 'Which planet is the largest in our solar system?',
    options: ['Saturn', 'Neptune', 'Jupiter', 'Uranus'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Jupiter is the king! More than 1,300 Earths could fit inside it!',
    coaching: 'Jupiter is by far the largest planet. It is so big that all the other planets could fit inside it combined!',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is Mars called the "Red Planet"?',
    options: ['It is very hot', 'It has red oceans', 'Its soil contains iron oxide (rust)', 'It reflects red light from the Sun'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Mars is red because its soil is full of iron oxide — the same stuff that makes rust!',
    coaching: 'Mars looks red because its surface is covered in iron oxide, which is basically rust! The same chemical reaction that turns a nail rusty makes Mars red.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which planet could float in water?',
    options: ['Jupiter', 'Mars', 'Saturn', 'Neptune'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Saturn is less dense than water, so it would float in a giant bathtub!',
    coaching: 'Saturn is the least dense planet — it is made mostly of gas and is less dense than water. If you had a bathtub big enough, Saturn would float!',
  },
];

export const sizeQuiz = [
  {
    question: 'About how many Earths could fit inside Jupiter?',
    options: ['About 100', 'About 500', 'About 1,300', 'About 5,000'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'About 1,300 Earths could fit inside Jupiter! It is truly enormous!',
    coaching: 'Jupiter is so massive that about 1,321 Earths could fit inside it. Look at the size chart — Jupiter dwarfs all the rocky planets!',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which planet is closest in size to Earth?',
    options: ['Mars', 'Venus', 'Mercury', 'Neptune'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Venus is almost the same size as Earth — they are sometimes called "sister planets"!',
    coaching: 'Venus has a diameter of about 7,521 miles, while Earth is about 7,918 miles. They are very close in size! Mars is much smaller.',
  },

export const temperatureQuiz = [
  {
    question: 'Which planet is the hottest in our solar system?',
    options: ['Mercury (closest to Sun)', 'Venus', 'Jupiter', 'Mars'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Venus is the hottest at 867°F! Its thick atmosphere traps heat like a super-powered greenhouse.',
    coaching: 'Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus is hotter because its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere traps heat. This is called the greenhouse effect!',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is Venus hotter than Mercury even though Mercury is closer to the Sun?',
    options: ['Venus has volcanoes', 'Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat', 'Venus is bigger', 'Venus spins faster'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Venus\'s thick atmosphere acts like a blanket, trapping heat in what scientists call the "greenhouse effect"!',
    coaching: 'Venus has a super thick atmosphere made of carbon dioxide. This traps the Sun\'s heat and does not let it escape — like being wrapped in a giant blanket. Mercury has almost no atmosphere, so heat escapes easily.',
  },
];

export const gravityQuiz = [
  {
    question: 'If you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, about how much would you weigh on Jupiter?',
    options: ['About 50 pounds', 'About 100 pounds', 'About 253 pounds', 'About 500 pounds'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Jupiter\'s gravity is 2.53 times Earth\'s, so you would weigh about 253 pounds!',
    coaching: 'Jupiter has much stronger gravity than Earth because it is so massive. You would weigh about 2.5 times more on Jupiter! Try the weight calculator above to check.',
  },
  {
    question: 'On which planet would you weigh the least?',
    options: ['Mercury', 'Mars', 'Pluto', 'The Moon'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Pluto has very weak gravity — you would weigh only about 6% of your Earth weight there!',
    coaching: 'Pluto is very small and has very weak gravity. If you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would only weigh about 6 pounds on Pluto! You could jump super high!',
  },

  {
    question: 'About how long does it take light from the Sun to reach Earth?',
    options: ['1 second', '8 minutes', '1 hour', '1 day'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Light takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the Sun to Earth!',
    coaching: 'Even though light is the fastest thing in the universe (186,000 miles per second!), the Sun is so far away that its light takes about 8 minutes to reach us.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which planet is farthest from the Sun?',
    options: ['Uranus', 'Pluto', 'Neptune', 'Saturn'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Neptune is the farthest planet at about 2.8 billion miles from the Sun!',
    coaching: 'Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun. Pluto is farther, but Pluto is a dwarf planet, not a full planet!',
  },
];

export const earthMoonQuiz = [
  {
    question: 'What causes day and night on Earth?',
    options: ['The Sun moves around Earth', 'Earth spins on its axis', 'The Moon blocks the Sun', 'Earth moves closer and farther from the Sun'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Earth spins (rotates) on its axis once every 24 hours, creating day and night!',
    coaching: 'Earth spins like a top on its axis. The side facing the Sun has daytime, and the side facing away has nighttime. One full spin takes 24 hours — that is one day!',
  },
  {
    question: 'What causes the seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter)?',
    options: ['Earth getting closer to the Sun', 'Earth\'s 23.5° tilt', 'The Moon\'s gravity', 'Clouds blocking the Sun'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Earth is tilted at 23.5 degrees, which means different parts get more or less sunlight as Earth orbits the Sun!',
    coaching: 'Seasons are caused by Earth\'s tilt, NOT by distance from the Sun! When your part of Earth tilts toward the Sun, you get more sunlight and it is summer. When it tilts away, it is winter.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take the Moon to go through all its phases?',
    options: ['About 7 days', 'About 14 days', 'About 29.5 days', 'About 365 days'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The Moon takes about 29.5 days to complete one full cycle of phases — almost one month!',
    coaching: 'The Moon orbits Earth in about 29.5 days, going through all 8 phases. That is why the word "month" comes from "Moon"!',
  },

export const nightSkyQuiz = [
  {
    question: 'What is a constellation?',
    options: ['A type of planet', 'A pattern of stars in the sky', 'A shooting star', 'A type of galaxy'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'A constellation is a pattern of stars that people connected like a dot-to-dot picture!',
    coaching: 'Constellations are patterns that ancient people saw when they connected stars with imaginary lines, like connect-the-dots. There are 88 official constellations!',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which star always points north and helps people find their direction?',
    options: ['Betelgeuse', 'The Sun', 'Polaris (North Star)', 'Antares'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Polaris, the North Star, always stays in the same spot in the sky, pointing north!',
    coaching: 'Polaris (the North Star) sits almost exactly above Earth\'s North Pole, so it always appears to stay in the same spot. You can find it using the Big Dipper!',
  },
  {
    question: 'What makes stars appear to twinkle?',
    options: ['They are turning on and off', 'Earth\'s atmosphere bends their light', 'They are very far away', 'The Moon reflects their light'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Stars do not actually twinkle! Earth\'s atmosphere bends and distorts their light, making them appear to shimmer.',
    coaching: 'Stars shine with a steady light, but Earth\'s atmosphere (the air around our planet) bends the light as it passes through, making it look like the stars are twinkling. That is why stars twinkle more near the horizon!',
  },
];

export const spaceEventsQuiz = [
  {
    question: 'What is a "shooting star" really?',
    options: ['A star falling from the sky', 'A tiny space rock burning up in our atmosphere', 'A piece of the Moon', 'A comet'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'A shooting star is a meteor — a tiny piece of space rock (often smaller than a grain of sand!) burning up in Earth\'s atmosphere!',
    coaching: 'Shooting stars are not stars at all! They are tiny pieces of space rock called meteoroids. When they hit Earth\'s atmosphere at high speed, they burn up and create a bright streak of light called a meteor.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens during a solar eclipse?',
    options: ['Earth blocks the Sun', 'The Moon passes between the Sun and Earth', 'The Sun disappears', 'Mars blocks the Sun'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'During a solar eclipse, the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Sun\'s light!',
    coaching: 'A solar eclipse happens when the Moon moves directly between the Sun and Earth, casting a shadow on Earth. Remember: NEVER look directly at a solar eclipse without special glasses!',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does a comet\'s tail always point away from the Sun?',
    options: ['Because it is moving away from the Sun', 'Because of the solar wind', 'Because of gravity', 'Because it is spinning'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'The solar wind (a stream of particles from the Sun) pushes the comet\'s tail away from the Sun!',
    coaching: 'The Sun blasts out a constant stream of tiny particles called the solar wind. This wind pushes the gas and dust from the comet away from the Sun, creating the tail. That is why the tail always points away from the Sun, no matter which direction the comet is moving!',
  },
